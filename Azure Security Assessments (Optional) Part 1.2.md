In addition to providing ongoing security monitoring of a customer's
existing Azure capabilities, oobe provides customers the opportunity to
identify any new Azure service they are looking to consume. oobe
provides an experienced Certified Information Systems Security
Professional (CISSP) with comprehensive Azure knowledge to undertake a
risk assessment of the requested service.

The risk assessment includes deployment of the service in an oobe lab to
practically determine any residual risks associated with key security
elements including, but not limited to, data sovereignty, system
hardening, management and monitoring, encryption and networking. In
identifying any residual risks, the oobe risk assessment also identifies
any recommended mitigation actions to consider when developing the
reference configuration of the Azure Service.

An example Azure Service Security Risk Assessment is provided at Annex
B. The Azure Service Security Risk Assessment does not provide the
reference security configuration for deployment. The risk assessment
identifies the complexity level associated with developing the Security
Configuration and customers can either develop their own configuration
or purchase the configuration from oobe.
