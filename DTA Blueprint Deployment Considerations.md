## Deployment Considerations {#deployment-considerations .oobe-Heading-2-Non-TOC}


oobe has demonstrated experience deploying the DTA Protected Utility
service for several Commonwealth government clients. oobe has refined
our delivery approach over these deployments and will focus early
engineering on the delivery of a baseline service configuration of the
DTA Protected Utility. oobe will work with {//COMPANY SHORT NAME//}
stakeholders to assess extant service configurations using our Perimeta
for 365 service assessment process. oobe will leverage its experience
with the DTA Protected Utility program to expedite and prioritise the
configuration of associated Microsoft 365 security settings in line with
the DTA solution documentation.

oobe will tailor its traditional systems engineering process to focus
engineering efforts on the immediate configuration of Microsoft 365
services to meet accelerated delivery times. oobe will leverage the
following high-level approach:

Engage Phase -- accelerated requirements workshops

Build Phase -- implementation of targeted DTA Protected Utility services
based on information and business decisions arising from the engage
phase.

{//COMPANY SHORT NAME//} use case uplift Phase (Optional) -- {//COMPANY
SHORT NAME//} design and configuration refinement of Microsoft 365
services to align with {//COMPANY SHORT NAME//} business process and
systems.
