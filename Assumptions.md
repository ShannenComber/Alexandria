  Assumption ID  Description
  -------------- --------------------------------------------------------
  A01            oobe consultants will be granted appropriate access and
                 approvals to deploy and configure the solution as
                 required to meet project deliverables / timelines.

  A02            Appropriate technical resources and application subject
                 matter experts will be available to respond to
                 questions.

  A03            {//Company Short Name//} will undertake lead
                 responsibility for processing any IRAP and/or PROTECTED
                 certifications if required.

  A04            Unless explicitly advised, all software, cloud
                 consumption and licensing required is considered GFE and
                 is the responsibility of the Commonwealth.

  A05            The organisation will grant oobe the Microsoft Digital
                 Partner of Record (DPOR) / Partner Admin Link (PAL) for
                 associated Microsoft cloud services and subscriptions.

  A06            The Commonwealth will share existing ICT platform
                 designs, security and network configuration
                 documentation.

  A07            AAT will champion all activities including, but not
                 limited to, governance and ITIL change management.

  A08            All implementation and support activities can be
                 performed remotely from oobe's Canberra-based premises
                 and therefore no travel budget is required.

  A09            All delivery activities will be undertaken during
                 standard business hours.

  A10            Commonwealth stakeholders will complete document reviews
                 in a timely manner. Acceptable review periods will be
                 dictated by the Commonwealth's project team but is
                 assumed to be within 3 working days of delivery by oobe
                 engineering.

  A11            All Commonwealth stakeholder review comments will be
                 delivered to oobe in a single MS Word document with
                 mark-up edits turned on.

  A12            Commonwealth deliverable document review cycles have
                 been priced on the assumption that a single document
                 review will be conducted by Commonwealth stakeholders.
                 Subsequent review cycles will be negotiated with oobe
                 but may incur additional engineering charges for
                 subsequent review cycles and associated documentation
                 updates.

  A13            Configuration is based on the DTA's Protected Utility
                 Blueprints and Configuration guide designed for the
                 Commonwealth.

  A14            This proposal includes effort to deploy the four core
                 Microsoft 365 online services as outlined in the DTA
                 Protected Utility blueprint offering (Exchange Online,
                 SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, and Teams).
                 Enablement of additional 365 services would be
                 undertaken under an additional engagement activity, if
                 required.

  A15            The configured Microsoft 365 service will leverage the
                 {//Company Short Name//} Secure Internet Gateway Service
                 and GovLink connectivity architecture.

  A16            AAT will provide a single hardware model for laptop
                 devices to be enrolled onto the delivered Microsoft 365
                 service via Autopilot. Additional hardware models will
                 require engineering effort from the optional Time and
                 Materials pricing.

  A17            AAT will provide a hardware list capable of being
                 ingested into the Intune Autopilot service.

  A18            All {//Company Short Name//} laptop devices will be
                 provided with a vanilla Windows 10, current Semi-Annual
                 Channel (SAC) Operating System installed. In the event
                 the laptop devices need to be rebuilt to a vanilla
                 Windows 10 SAC OS, {//Company Short Name//} will
                 leverage Optional Time and Materials engineering effort,
                 for oobe engineers to re-image the laptop devices in
                 preparation for enrolment via Autopilot.

  A19            No data migration services are required under this
                 engagement

  A20            oobe has included up to 5 days engineering toward tuning
                 the delivered Microsoft 365 services. All Use case
                 engineering in excess of the 5 days will be executed
                 under the optional Time and Materials pricing.

  A21            oobe has included up to 5 days engineering to conduct
                 high-level testing of the delivered Microsoft 365
                 services under the DTA Protected Utility deployment.
                 {//Company Short Name//} will perform use case testing
                 in excess of the high-level testing conducted by oobe
                 engineering.

  A22            AAT will leverage the optional Pre-Paid Capped
                 Engineering Service for {//Company Short Name//} M365
                 use cases, including onboarding of extant {//Company
                 Short Name//} Windows devices and initial M365 use case
                 pilot activities.
