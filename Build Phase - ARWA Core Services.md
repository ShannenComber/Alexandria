## Build Phase -- Core Services {#build-phase----core-services .oobe-Heading-2-Non-TOC}

oobe will execute a deployment and configuration of core Microsoft 365
services, in line with the DTA Protected Utility service documentation.
oobe will prioritise configuration of the core services identified
during the engage phase workshops.

oobe's Perimeta速 for 365 solution will be leveraged in the deployment of
the Microsoft 365 configuration and security settings, for Microsoft 365
core services, in line with the DTA Protected Utility design decisions.
Perimeta速 for 365 will accelerate platform build and configuration and
will be used beyond the initial deployment to ensure the {//COMPANY
SHORT NAME//} Microsoft 365 platform maintains the designed and
documented security posture. Below are the build tasks oobe will
undertake during Build Phase -- Core Services.
