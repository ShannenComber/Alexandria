## Annex B Risk Assessment Framework {#annex-b-risk-assessment-framework .oobe-Heading-2-Non-TOC}

**Introduction**

This document describes the risk framework used by oobe to perform Azure
service security assessments. The risk framework is based on a 5x5
matrix with risk ratings ranging from Very Low to Extreme based on their
respective likelihoods and consequences. The risk framework is designed
to be generic so that it can be applied to organisations of all sizes
and industries, including both Government and non-Government entities.

**Likelihoods**

The probability that a risk event will occur is defined as one of the
five likelihoods listed below in Table 11.

Table 13 \| Likelihoods

+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| 1.       | 2.  **Definition**                                        |

+==========+===========================================================+
| Almost   | High probability that the event will occur (\>90% chance  |
| Certain  | of occurrence over the life of the system leveraging the  |
|          | service).                                                 |
+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Likely   | Medium probability that the event will occur (60-90%      |
|          | chance of occurrence).                                    |
+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Possible | Reasonable probability that the event will occur (40-60%  |
|          | chance of occurrence).                                    |
+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Unlikely | Low probability that the event will occur (10-40% chance  |
|          | of occurrence).                                           |
+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Rare     | Very low probability that the event will occur (\<10%     |
|          | chance of occurrence).                                    |
+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------+

**Consequences**

The impact of a risk event occurring is defined as one of the five
consequences listed below in Table 12.

| Severe   | Eventuation of the risk event leads to significant injury |
|          | or economic harm to Australian citizens, intentional      |
|          | non-compliance with legal/regulatory requirements, severe |
|          | environmental damage, financial damage risking the        |

|          | breach of compliance with legal/regulatory requirements,  |
|          | minimal financial loss, and/or very low level of          |
|          | reputational damage to the organisation.                  |
