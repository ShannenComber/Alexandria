### Azure Service Catalogue (Optional) {#azure-security-catalogue-(optional) .oobe-Heading-3-Non-TOC}

After completing the Service Assessment, oobe builds a repeatable
pattern-based Security Configuration and associated templates and
blueprints. The configuration includes all the necessary elements to
mitigate residual risks identified during the assessment phase.

The configuration is integrated into the Perimeta for Azure Virtual Data
Centre and provided for deployment in the customer's Azure Service
Catalogue. The pattern deployment is provided as either an Azure
Resource Manager template, Blueprint or via a secure deployment Standard
Operating Procedure. The complete process incorporating the Security
Assessment, Security Configuration and Service Catalogue is outlined in
Annex C Perimeta Secure Service Catalogue.

The Service Catalogue and Security Configurations are not included as
part of Standard Support.
